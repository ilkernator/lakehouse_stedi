# lakehouse_stedi
Using AWS Glue, AWS S3, Python, and Spark, this project aims to extract  the data produced by the STEDI Step Trainer sensors and the mobile app, and curate them into a data lakehouse solution  on AWS so that Data Scientists can train the learning model. This project was part of the  Nanodegree Data Engineering Program offered by Udacity.
